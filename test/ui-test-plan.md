# UI test plan

Use Java 25 to compile and run Ted. Use the test-ui skill's
`scripts/run_ui_tests.ps1` runner, with two separator lines per command.
Stop at the first failure and record the expected and actual output.
The latest complete console transcript is [ui-test-session.txt](ui-test-session.txt).

## Release JAR smoke test

Aim: verify the distributable JAR runs with Java 25 from a fresh folder
containing only that JAR, including a folder name with spaces. Check every
command, valid and invalid dates, search rules, Unicode text, automatic
saving and restored tasks. Stop at the first failed command.

Run from the project root with Java 25 available as `java`:

```text
pwsh -File test/run-release-smoke.ps1 -JarPath PATH_TO_JAR
```

Replace `PATH_TO_JAR` with the JAR's path. If `java` selects another version,
also supply `-JavaExecutable` with the full path to Java 25. The script copies
the JAR into a new folder under `_temp`, launches it with `java -jar`, and
records both sessions in `test/ui-test-session.txt`. Generated files and
task data stay under ignored `_temp` folders.

The manual **Release JAR smoke test** GitHub Actions workflow checks the
same prebuilt release asset on Windows, Linux and macOS with Java 25.
Supply the asset's numeric GitHub ID and SHA-256. Each job verifies the
downloaded file's checksum, runs this script and prints its transcript.

The script checks complete response blocks. Empty list/search responses
must contain the heading and no rows. Lists and searches below must contain
exactly the specified rows in order, followed by Ted's separator.

### Restart the same JAR

Aim: verify task order, dates, event details, completion state and Unicode
descriptions survive restarting in the same launch folder.

| # | Command | Expected output fragment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `list` | The six saved rows above |
| 2 | `find book` | `1.[T][ ] borrow book`<br>`2.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2026)` |
| 3 | `find Book` | `1.[T][ ] Book launch` only |
| 4 | `find 読書` | `1.[T][X] café 読書` only |
| 5 | `bye` | `Bye. Hope to see you again soon!` |

## Commands, dates, and task operations

Aim: verify ISO dates display as `MMM dd yyyy`, a valid leap day is accepted,
invalid dates do not add tasks, and existing task operations still work.
Start in a new temporary working directory without `data/ted.txt`.
Send these commands in order. Each list must contain exactly the entries
shown, followed by the separator.

| --- | --- | --- |

| 33 | `bye` | `Bye. Hope to see you again soon!` |

## Restart with saved tasks

Aim: verify all task types, dates, order, and completion state survive restart.
Restart Ted in the same temporary working directory.

| # | Command | Expected output fragment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `list` | `Here are the tasks in your list:`<br>`1.[T][ ] borrow book`<br>`2.[D][X] return book (by: Oct 15 2026)`<br>`3.[D][ ] do homework (by: Feb 29 2024)`<br>`4.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)` |
| 2 | `bye` | `Bye. Hope to see you again soon!` |

## Invalid saved dates

Aim: verify impossible dates and older free-text deadlines are reported and
skipped while subsequent valid records are loaded.

Append a deadline dated `2026-02-30` on line 5, a deadline dated `Sunday` on
line 6, and an incomplete todo named `saved after invalid records` on line 7.
Use the existing URL-safe Base64 encoding for string fields.
Restart Ted in the same working directory and send these commands in order.

| # | Command | Expected output fragment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `list` | `OOPS!!! Skipping invalid saved task on line 5.`<br>`OOPS!!! Skipping invalid saved task on line 6.` |
| 2 | `list` | `Here are the tasks in your list:`<br>`1.[T][ ] borrow book`<br>`2.[D][X] return book (by: Oct 15 2026)`<br>`3.[D][ ] do homework (by: Feb 29 2024)`<br>`4.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)`<br>`5.[T][ ] saved after invalid records` |
| 3 | `bye` | `Bye. Hope to see you again soon!` |

## Find tasks

Aim: verify searches work on empty and populated lists, include all task types
and completion states, preserve task order, and only match descriptions.
Check literal substring matching, case sensitivity, multiple words, whitespace,
missing keywords, no matches, and search results after deletion.
Use a separate new temporary working directory for this session.
Each search or list response must contain exactly the entries shown,
followed by the separator.

| # | Command | Expected output fragment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `find book` | `Here are the matching tasks in your list:` |
| 2 | `todo wash dishes` | `[T][ ] wash dishes` |

| 26 | `bye` | `Bye. Hope to see you again soon!` |

## Find tasks after restart

Aim: verify searching restored tasks preserves descriptions, dates, completion
states, and order. Restart Ted in the search test's working directory.
